    "1. Write a function ``parse_cardata()`` that reads the file and parses the data into an appropriate datastructure say ``cardata`` and returns it. The choice of the datastructure is yours. \n",
    "2. Write a function ``cars_vs_age(cardata,bucketsize)`` that returns a histogram (as a dictionary), such that for each car we can know how many owners are there in an age range (defined by bucketsize).\n",
    "    * For example, if ``bucketsize=5``,then ``histogram[\"Creta\"][\"35-40\"] should return how many people own a creta in the age range 35-40.\n",
    "3. Write a function ``age_vs_cars(histogram)`` that inverts the histogram created by ``cars_vs_age(cardata,bucketsize)`` such that ``new_histogram[\"35-40\"][\"Creta\"]`` gives me how many people own a creta in the age range 35-40.\n",
    "4. Write a function ``company_vs_cars(cardata)`` that returns a map such that, ``company_vs_cars_map[\"Google\"]`` gives the list of cars owned by people in Google ordered ordered by descending frequency.\n",
